8c+ and 9a in the UK

The world's first 8c+, which could be easily even 9a in my opinion. It is not the most inspiring line, it seems more like a boulder problem with a rope and easier topout, but one must admit that it is of revolutionary difficulty for its time and I believe that it isn't by any means easier than Action Directe, the world's first 9a established a year later.

I really think Northern Lights is in a different league grade wise to all these other routes and I reckon one day will be considered 9a+.'

I was at the Tor the other day with Alex Megos who was working Mutation. I told him I thought there was no way Mutation was 9a and he agreed, so I think we can take it that the BMC guidebook is already wrong and Mutation is 9a+!

Hubble has taken me almost three times the amount of effort than any hard route which Iâ€™d previously done and I had to train specifically with Hubble in mind for almost a year. Having said that, I do believe that the knee which Sean McColl used may reduce the grade to hard 8c+.

the more I think about it, the more I realise I have no idea about the grade.

I would to comment on why I believe Hubble is 9a. In comparison to the other routes I have tried/done around this grade there is no doubt it is one of the hardest. I consider Hubble to be more of my style of climb and it took me almost the same amount of time to do as Rainshadow(Meant to be hard 9a). Last year I climbed 2 former 9as out in Spain, the first being Jungle Speed in only 4 attempts(this is a climb Daniel Woods has just sent and regraded at 9a). The second route was A-murete which took two days and is still debated between 8c+/9a, I took 8c+ as Rainshadow and Hubble still felt significantly harder. More locally Evolution 8c+ felt over a full grade easier, which I also sent last year in only three attempts.

Overshadow: The send felt quite easy in the end, but it's at the upper end of the grade for sure.
